# Simple jest implementation

This is a personal project, I mainly use this for convinience,
so I can code in my preferred editor with my settings and snippets,
and see the result in my console without the necessity to move between windows.o

This project uses Typescript!!!

Usage, change in the `test.ts` file, in the `splitter` function the type of
values you need, after that you need to add the tests cases in the `cases.txt` file.

> The values in the `cases.txt` file will be used exactly as they are in the file,
**INCLUDING SYMBOLS**
